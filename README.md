# Weather Application - React / Redux 

This repository contains all the files for the Capstone project of the [Udacity - Senior Web Developer Nanodegree - By Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/senior-web-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd802) course with [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). 

## Project Criteria

This application was created as a Weather Forecast application, with special focus on responsive display, proper form input usage, offline functionality, accessibility, scalable / reusable components, home screen installation, asynchronous requests, geolocation, and various gooogle APIs.

The application must meet the following criteria:

- Responsive - App is equally functional on mobile and dektop.
- Inputs - All form inputs have appropriate types, labels, placeholders and validators.
- Offline functionality - Application must function offline.
- Accessibility - All images have alternative text, focus is appropriately managed, elements are semantically used appropriately.
- Components - If components are used, they are self-contained units of functionality and declaratively configurable.
- Home Screen Installable - The application is installable to userâ€™s home screen.
- Native Features - Application uses native features, like push notifications, Bluetooth, geolocation, as appropriate for the application.
